# CircleSpace documentation

Hi everyone! For our final project we made CircleSpace, a web app that lets you make your own website! Although both of us got COVID during the few days leading up to the project submission deadline, we tried our best to make our project the best that it could be under the circumstances :)

# Features

Welcome to CircleSpace! Inspired by website builders such as Squarespace and Wix, we created a website that allows users to design their own homepage. Below is a description of how to use each of our website's features:

## CircleSpace (home)

This is where you'll see all the segments you add to your website homepage, such as headers, images, and videos. You can always return to this page by clicking CircleSpace. 

## Edit your page

This is where you can add and delete segments, and change the order of which the segments appear on the homepage. In the table, use the delete, move up, and move down buttons that correspond with the element you want to change. Below the table are six buttons, each of which will direct you to a page that allows you to submit a type of segment.

### Header

Enter some text into the header editor and it will create a header on your homepage.

### Paragraph

Enter some text into the header editor and it will create a paragraph on your homepage.

### Image

You can either enter a link to a photo hosted somewhere elsewhere on the internet or upload your own photo, after which it will appear on your homepage.

### Video

Enter a link to a YouTube video and it will render on your homepage.

### Spotify

Enter a link to any Spotify song, album or playlist and it will render on your homepage.

### Design

Select the fonts and background color for your website.

# View friend's website
You can look up a friend's website using their username and explore their homepage.
