# final-project-manual

This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.

Both of us got COVID during the few days leading up to the project submission deadline.

Welcome to CircleSpace! Inspired by website builders such as Squarespace and Wix, we created a website that allows users to design their own homepage. Below is a description of how to use each of our website's features:

CircleSpace (home): This is where you'll see all the segments you add to your website homepage, such as headers, images, and videos. You can always return to this page by clicking CircleSpace. 

Edit your page: This is where you can add and delete segments, and change the order of which the segments appear on the homepage. In the table, use the delete, move up, and move down buttons that correspond with the element you want to change. Below the table are six blocks, each of which will direct you to a page that allows you to submit a type of segment. For example, if you click the image block, it'll take you to a form that allows you to upload an image to add to the homepage. 

View friend's website: You can look up a friend's website using their username and explore their homepage.
